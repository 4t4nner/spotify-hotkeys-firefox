# Spotify Web Player Hotkeys Firefox Extension

This extension adds keyboard shortcuts to Firefox to play, pause, next and previous tracks in [Spotify Web Player](https://open.spotify.com).

## Usage

Default Keyboard shortcuts are:

- Play/Pause : Alt+Shift+P
- Next       : Alt+Shift+Right Arrow
- Previous   : Alt+Shift+Left Arrow
- Shuffle    : Alt+Shift+F
- Repeat     : Alt+Shift+R
- Play Album : Alt+Shift+B

The `Play Album or PlayGreen` shortcut play also play/pause the songs like the `Play/Pause` shortcut but is useful when Spotify Web Player gets stuck with an add.

Instead of using the keybord it's possible to click on the icon of the toolbar which will show the keybindings. Thanks to [Piatra](https://github.com/piatra)
